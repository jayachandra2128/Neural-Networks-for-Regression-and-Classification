# Neural-Networks-for-Regression-and-Classification

Objective of the assignment is to use NeuralNet class for regression, implement on my Regression data and writing NeuralNet nonlinear logistic regression class and applying to my classification data.. Other task is to implement 5-fold cross validation to find a good neural network parameters including the structure and report the test accuracy.Data selected for this assignment is "Housing data of King county, USA" and "Adult census income data". Below is overview of the approach i have followed in completing the assignment.

1) Visualizing and Analyzing the data

2) Preprocessing the data

2) NeuralNet class for regression

3) Cross validation to find optimum neural network parameters

4) Plots for results.

5) Analyzing prediction results and model analysis

6) Conclusion

7) NeuralNet nonlinear logistic regression class for classification

8) Cross validation to find optimum neural network parameters
